    <p>Samuel Boardman State Park is a park near the California and Oregon border along the coast. It is a hidden gem along the Pacific Coast highway filled with many scenic hikes with views of sea stacks. This specific picture of the natural bridges was taken by me after a very challenging hike. </p>
